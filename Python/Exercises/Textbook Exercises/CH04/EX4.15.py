# 4.15 (Game: lottery) Revise Listing 4.10, Lottery.py, to generate a three-digit lottery
# number. The program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and determines
# whether the user wins according to the following rules:
# 1. If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the award is
# $10,000.
# 2. If all the digits in the user input match all the digits in the lottery number, the
# award is $3,000.
# 3. If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is
# $1,000.
