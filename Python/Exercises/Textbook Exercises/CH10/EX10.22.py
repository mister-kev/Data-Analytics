# 10.22 (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon Collector is a classic statistics
# problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from a
# set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
# objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
# a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
# before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
# before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
# to get four cards, one from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible
# a card may be picked twice).
