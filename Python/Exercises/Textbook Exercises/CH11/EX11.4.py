# 11.4 (Compute the weekly hours for each employee) Suppose the weekly hours for all
# employees are stored in a table. Each row records an employeeâ€™s seven-day work
# hours with seven columns. For example, the following table stores the work hours
# for eight employees. Write a program that displays employees and their total hours
# in decreasing order of the total hours.
