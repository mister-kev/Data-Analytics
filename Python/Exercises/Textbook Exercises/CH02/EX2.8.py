# (Science: calculate energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to
# heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should
# prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final
# temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
# Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
# where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
# and energy Q is measured in joules.

water = eval(input("Enter the amount of water in kilograms:"))
initTemp = eval(input("Enter the initial temperature:"))
finTemp = eval(input("Enter the final temperature:"))
q = water * (finTemp - initTemp) * 4184
print("The energy needed is",q)
