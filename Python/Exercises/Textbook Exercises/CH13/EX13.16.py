# 13.16 (Create large dataset) Create a data file with 1000 lines. Each line in the file consists
# of a faculty first name, last name, rank, and salary. Facultyâ€™s first name and
# last name for the ith line are FirstNamei and LastNamei. The rank is randomly
# generated as assistant, associate, and full. The salary is randomly generated as a
# number with two digits after the decimal point. The salary for assistant professor
# should be in the range from 50,000 to 80,000, for associate professor from 60,000
# to 110,000, and for full professor from 75,000 to 130,000. Save the file in
# Salary.txt. Here are some sample data:.
# FirstName1 LastName1 assistant 60055.95
# FirstName2 LastName2 associate 81112.45
# . . .
# FirstName1000 LastName1000 full 92255.21
