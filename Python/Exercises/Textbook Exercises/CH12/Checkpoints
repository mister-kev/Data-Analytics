To define a class that extend a super class, we use the following syntax:
    subclassName(superclassName):
        super().__init__()
The super() keyword is used to refer to the superclass, The superclass initializer
is invoked using super().__init__()

#12.2
The variable i in class A is not inherited in class B, so we
cannot access variable i from the object b. To fix it, we have to
invoke super().__init__() in the class B’s __init__ method.

#12.3
False.

#12.4
Yes. Using the following syntax
class Subclass(SuperClass1, SuperClass2, ...):
    initializer
    methods

Encapsulation: the details of implementation are encapsulated and hidden from the user.
In essence, encapsulation combines data and methods into a single object and hides the
data fields and method implementation from the user.

Inheritance: The inheritance relationship enables a subclass to inherit features from its superclass with
additional new features. A subclass is a specialization of its superclass; every instance of a
subclass is also an instance of its superclass, but not vice versa.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism means that an object of a subclass can be passed to a parameter of a
superclass type.

#12.17
the common types of relationships among classes are:
1) Inheritance
2) Association
3) Aggregation
4) Composition

#12.18
•	Company and Employee >>  Association
•	Course and Faculty   >>	 Aggregation
•	Student and Person   >>	 Inheritance
•	House and Window     >>	 Composition
•	Account and Savings Account	 >> Inheritance
