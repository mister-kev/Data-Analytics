## Exemplary Examples:

> [Playground & Cheatsheet for Learning Python](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python). <br>
> This is one of the best repositories I've seen in learning Python. The repository is broken out by topic (Numbers, Functions, etc.) for learning Python. It is done in code format (via comments) to solidify learning and to orient the user to the Python language.
